		<h3> A Plant Diagnosis Tool</h3>
		</header>
		<p>Green Thumb is a mobile app that tracks the health of indoor plants and diagnoses diseases. Create profiles for each of your house plants and measure their health with the Green Thumb soil probe. Using these measurements, Green Thumb will send alerts when your plant requires water or fertilisation. If you start to notice some unusual changes in your plant or a rapid decline in health, Green Thumb’s diagnostic tools will use photos and your probe readings to identify if your plant has become diseased and suggest solutions to restore it.</p>
		<p>Once you’ve found your gardening groove and your plants are in peak condition, flex their #leafgains in the Green Thumb community. Users can share pictures, ask questions/troubleshoot problems and even organise plant swaps with other gardeners in your area. Green Thumb takes the guesswork out of gardening, empowering even the most novice plant parent with the tools to grow their indoor jungle.</p>
		<h3>But why?</h3>
		<p>As we find ourselves home-office bound while the pandemic rages on, many of us are looking to update our space and bring the outdoors in with the addition of plants. As well as looking beautiful, many indoor plants work to purify the air we breathe and according to a <a href:"https://extension.uga.edu/publications/detail.html?number=B1318&title=Growing%20Indoor%20Plants%20with%20Success">2007 study by The American Society for Horticultural Science</a>, they may even increase our productivity at work. There is no better time to build your plant collection and Green Thumb is here to help you succeed.</p>
		<p>Traditionally, when entering the gardening world, many plant lives are lost, and money wasted as we try to build our gardening skills and learn what not to do. Beginners are often uncertain of when to water or what soil to choose and online forums seem to cause more confusion than clarity. Green Thumb is a one stop shop for beginners, providing them with tailored information about their specific species of plant by drawing information from trusted horticultural resources via APIs.</p>
		<p>The recent development of smart pots only provides data pertaining to soil moisture levels and temperature yet cannot diagnose disease. Green Thumb takes the functionalities of a smart pot into a probe allowing it to be used across multiple plants to reduce costs for consumers. Utilising Arduino technology, the probe measures not just moisture and temperature but also soil nutrients and PH to give a clearer picture of overall plant health.</p>
		<p>By comparing photos taken by users with the data derived from the probe measurements Green Thumb can accurately diagnose plant disease. Unlike existing diagnosis apps that rely on photo matching AI alone, Green Thumb digs further to find the cause of disease while providing guidance for treatment and future prevention.</p>
		<h3>How does it work?</h3>
		<p>Green Thumb comprises two pieces of technology: a soil probe and a phone app. These technologies communicate information to each other to assist plant growers in tracking plant health. The probe consists of sensors to accurately measure soil nutrition while the app records these measurements, assesses plant health and connects users via forums. Combined, this technology serves as a powerful education tool and database for novice and advanced gardeners alike.</p>
		<img src="images/figure-1.png" alt="figure 1" height="350" style="float:left;"/>
		<p style:"float:right;">The Green Thumb soil probe uses sensors to measure the temperature, moisture and PH level of your plants’ soil. To collect measurements, the probe is placed directly into the soil of a pot (see figure 1) and is triggered by a button on the Green Thumb app to collect measurements. The measurements are transmitted to the app through Bluetooth and stored in the apps database. The soil probe is a battery powered, handheld device so that it can be used for countless plants. The ease of use and portability appeals to a wide market of plant growers and saves them money. The soil probe is the essential tool for this project which gives Green Thumb a competitive advantage against other plant health apps on the market.</p>
		<p>The primary function of the Green Thumb app is a plant health database. Upon signing up, users are prompted to build their first plant profile in the app (see figures 2 and 3). They are guided through a series of questions regarding the plant species and variety. The app uses the information provided in this questionnaire to set the values for each variable of plant health measured through the soil probe. If the results of the soil probe detects a false value (i.e. a measurement outside of the healthy range for that plant type) the app will alert the user and provide a suggestion to restore the plant back to health. Plant profiles store the data received from the soil probe to allow users to look back over historical data and compare variables through helpful infographics. Additionally, users can also upload photos of their plant to its respective profile to track growth and changes in its appearance.</p>

		<p>Another innovative function of the Green Thumb app is the powerful diagnosis tool (see figure 4). If a user notices change in their plant’s appearance and is concerned that their plant has become diseased, they can use this tool to diagnose the disease and learn how to restore their plant. When launching the diagnosis tool, users are instructed to upload photos of the affected area of the plant. These photos are run through Green Thumb’s catalogue of plant disease images to identify possible diagnosis’. Next, the user is required to use the soil probe to take soil readings. The diagnosis tool compares these results to the values set in the plant profile and the images to determine the cause of the disease. For example, if images display white spots on leaves and the soil probe detects high nitrogen levels the diagnosis tool will determine that spider mites are the cause of plant decay. This diagnosis is then stored in the relevant plant profile so users can track their plants journey back to health. The combination of this AI technology and soil health readings make Green Thumb’s diagnosis tool highly accurate and mitigates the risk of mistreatment.</p>
		<img src="images/figure-4.png" alt="figure 4" height="450"/><img src="images/figure-5.png" alt="figure 5" height="450"/>
		<p>The final function of the Green Thumb app is the “Community”, a text and image-based forum which allows users to connect with one another. Users are able to post images of their plants, asl questions for other users to answer and create polls. The community displays posts on the app (see figure 5) in chronological order and employs an infinite scroll plugin to allow users to browse with ease. Additionally, the community features an inbox function where they can communicate privately.  As powerful a tool as AI is, we recognise that personal advice from gardening veterans is generally preferred so the community allows users to compare information from both sources.</p>
		<h3>Tools & Technologies</h3>

<h3>Skills Required</h3>
<p>As there are so many working parts to this project, it will require the contribution of several skilled programmers and software engineers as well as horticulturalists to test the performance and accuracy of the app and probe.</p>
<p>The soil probe will require engineers who have experience working with Arduino systems to build similar devices. Whilst I have no experience in this field, the Arduino website will serve as a helpful resource as it provides countless tutorials for building similar technology which could be easily adapted to this project. The engineers (or myself, if I’m up for the challenge!) will need to work alongside programmers who are fluent in C++ to code the probe within the Arduino program allowing it to perform and communicate with the app.</p>
<p>The Green Thumb app will be built in MIT App Inventor 2 which uses a block based coding language that can be navigated by even the most beginner programmers like myself. However, it would be advantageous to seek help from JavaScript fluent programmers so they can use their expertise to incorporate JS plugins to enhance the user experience and interface of the app. Additionally, software engineers with experience building databases and AI are essential for the success of this project.</p>
<p>It will be critical to consult with horticulturalists and soil experts to ensure we are providing users with the most accurate information. Their feedback will be a crucial component in improving the app and as such I would seek their feedback at regular intervals throughout the development of the project. This way, we can adapt the Green Thumb based on their feedback early on rather than having to change everything at completion. This would ensure we can meet our project deadlines and stay within the agreed budget.</p>
<p>To outsource labour, I will post ads in industry specific job boards such as <a href:"https://www.hiretechladies.com/jobs">Tech Ladies</a>, to draw from a talented pool of professionals. Once the team has been built we will rely on communicative technologies including Discord to collaborate and cloud based project management apps to track the progress of the project and assign tasks.</p>

<h3>Outcome</h3>
<p>Once built and on the market, Green Thumb will be an affordable solution that fills the knowledge gap for new plant parents. Green Thumb will empower these consumers to become confident plant growers, allowing them to save money by not having to replace dead plants while growing their collection and making friends with other like minded individuals.</p>
<p>For the more seasoned plant grower, Green Thumb will appeal to their already vested interest in indoor plants. It will allow them to track their plants' health in a way that was previously not viable for at-home growers. Additionally, Green Thumb could be utilized in a commercial setting, allowing nurseries to ensure the health of their plants and pass this data onto customers at the point of purchase.</p>

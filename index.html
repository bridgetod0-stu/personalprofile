							<p>I was born and raised in the Blue Mountains in NSW, Australia. I grew up exploring the bushland and to this day hiking and exploring are some of my favourite hobbies. At home, we only spoke English but after extensive travel throughout Asia and struggling with language barriers, I challenged myself to learn an Asian language. After a few years of study and countless hours of anime watching, I can now speak Japanese at a conversational level and am eagerly awaiting the chance to flex my skills in post-COVID Japan.</p>

						<h2>Interest in IT</h2>
							</header>
							<p>I have always had a curiosity for IT, from a young age I would beg my parents to let me use the family computer so I could try to beat the computer at chess or pursue my artistic dreams on Microsoft paint. My interest in IT surged when I heard that dial-up tone and as I connected to the world wide web for the very first time. The internet has been such a powerful tool for fuelling my interest in IT. I've learned to code my own games in Scratch, build brand new websites and now I'm excited to transform my interest into a career through RMIT.</p>
							<p>Initially, I wanted to study at RMIT for superficial reasons, I've always been amazed by their buildings in Melbourne CBD and was keen to be involved with an institution that wasn't afraid to push the boundaries. When I delved further, I was pleased to read in the course overview that the topics covered align with my career goals and the ability to study online was the cherry on top!</p>
							<p>During this course, I expect to equip myself with the tools to troubleshoot, design and navigate everything from cloud computing to mobile applications and even artificial intelligence. I am particularly interested in building my programming skills to advance my freelance web design services and move into full stack web development.</p>

		<h2>So, What's Bridget Like?</h2>
		<p>My mum says I'm great! but let's delve further...</p>

		<h3>Myer Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI)</h3>

		<p style:"float:right;">I have always been a creative individual who is driven to make a difference in people’s lives and these results confirm that. I have learnt that these traits also make me prone to burn out and as such I would benefit from working in a team environment where I can seek assistance from colleagues. My altruistic traits make me a great team player, in any group scenario I work hard to make sure we achieve the best results – even if that means picking up the slack of others. To avoid this becoming a problem, I should seek dedicated and diverse teammates so we can delegate tasks based on everyone’s individual skills and weaknesses. Additionally, I should seek an open-minded team with a flat hierarchy so that I will be given the opportunity to express my opinions and perspectives.</p>
		<h3><a href="http://www.educationplanner.org/">Education Planner</a> Learning Style Test</h3>

		<p>These test results confirm that I am primarily a visual learner. I learn best when I am presented with graphic representations of information and data. It may be difficult for me to work alongside auditory learners who prefer to communicate through speech or text. As such, it is important to address my needs with others and come up with solutions that can incorporate both our learning styles. One such solution could be switching from phone call catch ups to in-person meetings with presentations or PowerPoints that visually and verbally convey the agenda. Ideally when forming teams, I should seek other visual learners like myself however as my results show a fairly even spread across the three different styles, I trust that I could adapt to work alongside any learning style.</p>
		<h3><a herf="https://www.revelian.com/employer/product/emotify/">Revelian “Emotify”</a> Emotional Intelligence Test</h3>
		<img src="images/emotify.png" alt="Emotify Test Reults" height="250"/>
		<p>As the results show, I possess a high level of emotional intelligence which would be beneficial in any team-based environment. I am highly skilled in identifying and understanding the emotions of others allowing me to build strong relationships with teammates. When working in a team, I can draw upon my emotional intelligence to easily collaborate with others and make decisions that will benefit all members of the team. The results of this test suggest that I would be quick to adapt to any team I am placed in, furthermore I can extend my skills to conflict resolution wherever issues may arise.</p>
